		<h1>Re/Balance</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the very temporary home of the still-in-the-making Re/Balance book (maybe temporary title too).</p>
    <p>This is the main premise: <strong>client / agency relationships are unbalanced</strong>. Clients take most of the risks, but also most of the rewards (if things go well). Agencies barely take any risks, their income almost guaranteed regardless of actual product performance. I believe this is the source of many of the behaviours we see in the industry.</p>
    <p>Re/Balance is an attempt at exploring why we have the problems that we have and an attempt at exploring a different kind of relationship between clients and agencies. A new relationship based on collaboration, empathy and humility. A new relationship with a more equal split of risk and reward where clients relinquish a bit of control and agencies step up and take a bigger responsibility in defining what the solution to the problem is.</p>
    <p>You can get the book for free (or contribute) in the <a href="https://leanpub.com/rebalance">Re/Balance page on Leanpub</a>.</p>

    <p>Thanks : )</p>
